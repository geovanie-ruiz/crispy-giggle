Comprehensive Rules
1) Game Overview
1-1. Number of Players
1-1-1. Gundam Card Game is a competitive game between two players. Refer to
the multiplayer rules for rules that apply to games conducted with other
player counts.
1-2. Winning and Losing the Game
1-2-1. When either player is defeated, the game ends. When one opponent is
defeated, the opponent who was not defeated wins the game.
1-2-2. The following are all game conditions that result in defeat.
1-2-2-1. When either player receives battle damage from a Unit while they
have no cards in their shield area, that player fulfills the conditions for
defeat.
1-2-2-2. When either player has no cards remaining in their deck, that player 
2
fulfills the conditions for defeat.
1-2-3. If either player fulfills the conditions for defeat, the next time rules
management is performed, that player loses the game as a result. (See 11.
Rules Management)
1-2-4. During a game, any player may concede at any time. That player
immediately loses and the game ends.
1-2-5. There are no card effects that force a player to concede. Loss of the game by
conceding is never a substitution of any substitution effect.
1-3. Fundamental Game Rules
1-3-1. While the rules of the game are fundamentally defined within this
comprehensive ruleset, there may be exceptions that arise due a card’s
effects or special rules. If the text written on a card contradicts the
comprehensive rules, the text on the card takes precedence.
1-3-2. If a player is required to perform an action that is not possible for any reason,
that action is not performed. If a player is required to perform an action and
only part of that action is not possible, the player must perform as much of
the action as possible.
1-3-2-1. If you are required to put an entity into some state that entity is
already in, the entity remains in the state it was in, and the action
putting it into that state is not performed.
Ex: If you are instructed to rest a Unit that is currently rested, since the
Unit is already rested, it is not rested again.
1-3-2-2. If for any reason you are required to perform zero or less repetitions
of an action, the action is not performed. An opposite action is not
performed for negative repetition counts.
1-3-3. When a card’s effect requires an action that an active effect prevents, the
active effect takes precedence, and the action is prevented.
1-3-4. When both players are required for any reason to make a selection
simultaneously, the active player chooses first. The standby player chooses
after that.
1-3-5. Unless specified otherwise, when choosing a number for a card or a rule,
you must choose a whole number equal to or greater than one. You cannot
choose a negative or fractional number.
1-3-6. When numerical information on a card is modified by a card’s effect, the
result will be a whole number. If the result would be negative, treat it as zero 
3
unless it will be modified by another effect.
1-3-7. Unless specified otherwise, a card’s effects are performed in the order they
appear in the text on the card.

new starting hand. Then, shuffle your deck.
6-2-1-7. After Player One has announced whether or not they will redraw,
Player Two may redraw according to the same rules explained in 6-2-
1-6-1 above.
6-2-2. Each player takes the top six cards of their deck, one at a time, and places
them face down into their shield section without looking at them. When
doing so, place each card so it overlaps the previous one, starting with the
card nearest to you.
6-2-3. Each player places one active EX Base token card into their base section.
6-2-4. Player Two places one active EX Resource token card into their resource
area.
6-2-5. The game begins with Player One’s turn.
7) Game Progression
7-1. Turn Flow
7-1-1. Each turn progresses with the completion of five phases in order: start phase,
draw phase, resource phase, main phase, and end phase.
7-1-2. During a game, one of the two players controls game progress as the active
player. The active player completes phases in the order described below.
7-1-3. During each phase, if effects are triggered by actions taken that phase, play
does not advance to the next phase until all of those effects are resolved.
7-2. Start Phase
7-2-1. The start phase consists of two steps, which are performed in order: active
step and start step.
7-2-2. During each step, if effects are triggered by actions taken that step, play
does not advance to the next step until all of those effects are resolved.
7-2-3. Active Step
7-2-3-1. The active player sets to active all rested cards placed in their battle
area, resource area, and base section.
7-2-3-2. All cards are set to active simultaneously during the active step, and
in no particular order.
7-2-4. Start Step
7-2-4-1. Effects that specify “at the start of the turn” activate.
7-2-5. After all of the steps listed above have been completed, the start phase ends 
16
and you move to the draw phase.
7-3. Draw Phase
7-3-1. The active player draws one card from their deck and adds it to their hand.
7-3-1-1. When they draw a card and their deck then has no cards in it, they
immediately lose the game.
7-4. Resource Phase
7-4-1. The active player places one Resource card from their resource deck into
their resource area face up and active.
7-5. Main Phase
7-5-1. The active player may choose from the following list of actions permitted
during the main phase: play a card from their hand, activate an 【Activate･
Main】 effect, and attack with a Unit. These actions may be performed in
any order as many times as desired within their permissible limits. With the
exception of actions performed due to an ability, these actions may only be
performed when there are currently no abilities that have been triggered and
are awaiting activation.
7-5-2. Playing Cards from the Hand
7-5-2-1. The active player may perform the following actions in any order as
many times as desired with cards from the hand by paying their cost:
deploy a Unit, deploy a Base, pair a Pilot, and activate a Command
card with 【Main】 timing. (See 3. Card Types)
7-5-2-2. When playing a card from the hand, follow the steps listed below.
7-5-2-2-1. Reveal the card you wish to play from your hand.
7-5-2-2-2. Confirm you have a sufficient number of Resources to fulfill its
Lv. condition.
7-5-2-2-3. Choose the number of Resources necessary to pay its cost and
rest them.
7-5-2-2-4. Play the card. (See 3. Card Types)
7-5-3. 【Activate･Main】 Activation
7-5-3-1. The active player can activate effects with 【Activate･Main】 timing.
(See 11-2-1. 【Activate･Main】)
7-5-4. Attack with a Unit
7-5-4-1. The active player can attack the opposing player or a rested enemy
Unit with a Unit in their battle area. (See 7. Attacking and Battles)
7-5-5. End of the Main Phase
7-5-5-1. In addition to the actions listed above, the active player may declare 
17
the end of the main phase during their main phase.
7-5-5-2. When the end of the main phase is declared, the turn immediately
enters the end phase.
7-6. End Phase
7-6-1. The end phase consists of four steps, which are performed in order: action
step, end step, hand step, and cleanup step.
7-6-2. During each step, if effects are triggered by actions taken that step, play
does not advance to the next step until all of those effects are resolved.
7-6-3. Action Step
7-6-3-1. Taking turns, starting with the standby player, players can activate
【Action】 Command cards and effects with 【Activate･Action】
timing. (See 9. Action Steps)
7-6-4. End Step
7-6-4-1. Effects that specify “at the end of the turn” activate.
7-6-5. Hand Step
7-6-5-1. If the number of cards in your hand exceeds the upper limit of 10,
discard cards of your choosing until you only have 10.
7-6-6. Cleanup Step
7-6-6-1. Effects with the duration limit “during this turn” lose effect. Resolve
any triggered effects or the like which activate as a result.
7-6-7. After all of the steps listed above have been completed, the end phase ends
and the turn passes to the opponent.
8) Attacking and Battles
8-1. Using a main phase attack with a Unit, the active player may use one of their Units
to attack the opposing player or a rested enemy Unit in the battle area. If they
attack, enter battle and perform the following five steps in order: attack step,
block step, action step, damage step, and battle end step.
8-2. Attack Step
8-2-1. Select one active Unit in your battle area and rest it, then declare an attack
target. The attack target can be either the opposing player or a rested enemy
Unit.
8-2-2. Effects with 【Attack】 or “when this Unit attacks” timing activate.
8-2-3. Effects worded “during this battle” gain effect now.
8-2-4. At the end of the attack step, if the attacking Unit or the Unit targeted for
attack has been destroyed or otherwise moved to another location due to 
18
some event, continue to the battle end step rather than the block step.
8-3. Block Step
8-3-1. The standby player may activate <Blocker> on one of their active Units in
the battle area. When activated, this effect changes the attack target of the
attacking Unit to the Unit with <Blocker>.
8-3-2. The <Blocker> effect can be activated only one time in response to each
attack.
8-3-3. A Unit originally targeted for attack cannot activate its own <Blocker>
effect.
8-3-4. Choosing not to activate a <Blocker> effect is also allowed.
8-3-5. At the end of the block step, if the attacking Unit or the Unit targeted for
attack has been destroyed or otherwise moved to another location due to
some event, continue to the battle end step rather than the action step.
8-4. Action Step
8-4-1. Taking turns starting with the standby player, players may activate
【Action】 Command cards and 【Activate･Action】 effects. (See 8. Action
Steps)
8-4-2. At the end of the action step, if the attacking Unit or the Unit targeted for
attack has been destroyed or otherwise moved to another location due to
some event, continue to the battle end step rather than the damage step.
8-5. Damage Step
8-5-1. Confirm the attacking Unit’s attack target at this point. If the attack target is
a player, an attack on a player succeeds. If the attack target is an enemy Unit,
an attack on a Unit succeeds.
8-5-2. Attack on a Player
8-5-2-1. After an attack on a player has succeeded, check the opponent’s
shield area.
8-5-2-2. If there is no Base and not a single Shield in the opponent’s shield
area, the attacking Unit deals battle damage equal to its AP to the
opposing player. A player receiving damage is immediately defeated,
and the player who owns the attacking Unit wins the game.
8-5-2-3. If there is a Shield but no Base in the enemy shield area, the attacking
Unit deals damage equal to its AP to the top Shield in the shield area.
8-5-2-3-1. A Shield receiving 1 or more damage is destroyed and placed
into the trash after revealing it. If the revealed Shield has a
【Burst】 effect, choose whether or not to activate it before 
19
placing the Shield into the trash. (See 12-2-5. 【Burst】)
8-5-2-4. If there is a Base in the enemy shield area, the attacking Unit deals an
amount of battle damage equal to its AP to the Base targeted for attack.
8-5-2-4-1. Use counters to track dealt damage. A Base whose HP
becomes zero is destroyed and placed into the trash.
8-5-2-4-2. If the attacking Unit has <First Strike>, it deals battle damage
to the enemy Base before normal battle damage is managed.
(See 12-1-5. <First Strike>)
8-5-3. Attack on a Unit
8-5-3-1. If an attack on a Unit succeeds, deal damage between the two Units.
8-5-3-2. The attacking Unit deals damage equal to its AP to the Unit targeted
for attack simultaneously as the Unit targeted for attack deals damage
equal to its AP to the Attacking Unit.
8-5-3-2-1. Use counters to track dealt damage. A Unit whose HP
becomes zero is destroyed and placed into the trash.
8-5-3-2-2. If the attacking Unit has <First Strike>, it deals battle damage
to the enemy Unit before normal battle damage is managed.
(See 12-1-5. <First Strike>)
8-5-3-2-3. If both battling Units are destroyed, their destruction is
treated as happening simultaneously.
8-5-4. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, continue to
the battle end step.
8-6. Battle End Step
8-6-1. All effects worded “during this battle” lose effect.
8-6-2. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, the battle ends,
and you return to the main phase. (See 6-5. Main Phase)
9) Action Steps
9-1. An action step occurs after the block step and during the end phase.
9-2. During an action step, taking turns starting with the standby player, players may
activate 【Action】 Command cards and 【Activate･Action】 effects.
9-3. The standby player may choose to perform one of the following actions: activate an
【Action】 Command card, activate an 【Activate･Action】 effect, or pass.
9-3-1. Activating an 【Action】 Command card is the act of paying the cost of a
Command card in your hand with an 【Action】 effect to play it and activate
that effect.
20
9-3-2. Activating an 【 Activate ･ Action 】 effect is the act of fulfilling the
conditions for an 【Activate･Action】 effect on a card and activating it.
9-3-3. Pass means doing nothing and letting the right to take an action pass to your
opponent.
9-4. Next, the active player may choose one of the following actions: activate an
【Action】 Command card, activate an 【Activate･Action】 effect, or pass.
9-4-1. Unless both players have consecutively declared that they are passing, the
right to take an action once again passes back to the standby player.
9-4-2. Continue in this manner, standby player → active player → standby player
and so on, until both players consecutively declare they are passing.
9-5. When both players have consecutively declared they are passing, the action step
ends.
10) Effect Activation and Resolution
10-1. Effects
10-1-1. An effect consists of a directive and related compensation which originate
from the text on a card.
10-1-2. Unless the text specifies otherwise, an effect will only affect cards on the
field. If a location for where to activate the effect is not specified, an effect
on a Unit or Base can only be activated while that card is in the battle or
shield area.
10-1-3. Some effects instruct you to perform them, while others state “you may”
perform them. If instructed to perform an effect, perform as much of it as
possible. If told “you may” perform an effect, you may also choose not to
activate that effect.
10-1-4. Effects are divided into five types, depending on their contents and trigger
conditions: constant, triggered, activated, command, and substitution.
10-1-5. Constant Effects
10-1-5-1. A constant effect is an effect that remains constantly active in some
form.
10-1-5-2. A constant effect will remain active the entire time it is in a location
where it activates.
10-1-5-3. Some constant effects only activate while certain conditions are
fulfilled. As long as they are in a location where they activate and those
conditions are fulfilled, they will remain active the entire time.
10-1-5-4. Constant effects do not wait to be triggered or activated. They are 
21
active from the moment they enter the location where they activate.
10-1-5-5. When multiple constant effects are active, they will all overlap.
10-1-5-6. When multiple constant effects with conflicting contents are active,
effects that state other effects “can’t” have an effect, or otherwise
disallow them, take precedence.
10-1-5-7. A constant effect with a conditional target is applied the moment a
target fulfilling those conditions appears.
10-1-6. Triggered Effects
10-1-6-1. A triggered effect activates automatically when some conditional
event occurs during the game. Triggered effects include effects that
specify timing, such as 【Deploy】, 【Attack】, 【Destroyed】, and
【When Paired】. They also include effects that include a condition
such as “when (some event occurs)” in their text.
10-1-6-1-1. In the absence of a restriction, such as 【Once per Turn】,
the effect activates every time the condition is fulfilled.
10-1-6-2. A triggered effect will not trigger or activate unless its trigger
conditions are fulfilled.
10-1-6-3. If multiple events fulfilling a trigger condition occur simultaneously,
the effect will only trigger and activate one time.
10-1-6-4. If a card with a triggered effect leaves the location where it is active
while that effect is waiting to be activated after it was triggered, the
effect still activates.
10-1-6-5. If multiple effects belonging to you trigger, they do so
simultaneously, and you resolve them in the order you decide.
10-1-6-6. If multiple effects belonging to both you and your opponent trigger,
they do so simultaneously, and all of the active player’s triggered
effects are resolved first, after which all of the standby player’s
triggered effects are resolved.
10-1-6-7. If a new effect triggers while multiple effects are being resolved, give
that new effect priority and resolve it.
10-1-6-8. If there is a 【Burst】 effect among multiple triggered effects, give
that 【Burst】 effect priority over all others and resolve it first.
10-1-7. Activated Effects
10-1-7-1. An activated effect can be freely activated by the player. These
include 【Activate･Main】 and 【Activate･Action】 effects.
10-1-7-2. When an activated effect’s timing permits activation, satisfying the 
22
actions described before the colon will activate the effect described
after the colon.
10-1-7-3. Some activated effects specify the symbol “①” as a condition. When
this symbol appears, paying a cost equal to the number printed within
the symbol satisfies the condition and allows the effect to be activated.
10-1-7-4. Some activated effects have two or more conditions which appear as
“【Activate･Action】 (condition 1), (condition 2)：.” In this case,
satisfying all of the conditions will activate the effect described
following the colon.
10-1-7-5. If an activated effect has neither a colon nor conditions for
activating it listed, you can activate it by declaring you are doing so.
10-1-8. Command Effects
10-1-8-1. A command effect activates when it is played during the timing
specified on a Command card, which can be either 【Main】, or
【Action】, or both.
10-1-8-1-1. If a command effect requires choosing a target, playing that
Command card is not possible if that target cannot be chosen.
10-1-9. Substitution Effects
10-1-9-1. When some event would occur, a substitution effect replaces the
implementation of that event with another event.
10-1-9-1-1. If an effect reads “(do) B instead of A,” the portion B that
occurs due to that capability is a substitution effect.
10-2. Effect Conditions
10-2-1. When certain conditions are required for an effect to activate, it will not
activate unless those conditions are fulfilled.
10-2-2. If an effect requires choosing a target, that effect will not activate if the
target cannot be chosen.
10-2-3. Even if an effect’s conditions are fulfilled, that effect will not activate if it is
restricted by an effect that disallows it.
10-3. Effect Activation Steps
10-3-1. When activating an effect, follow the steps listed below.
10-3-1-1. If conditions are required to activate the effect, they must be
fulfilled, otherwise the effect cannot be activated.
10-3-1-2. Declare you are activating the effect. If the effect is on a card in your
hand and can be activated at that time, reveal the card.
10-3-1-3. Activate the declared effect.
23
10-3-1-4. Resolve all events which occur in response to activating the effect.
10-3-2. If the effect you wish to activate is on a Command card, present the card
and perform the effect listed on it.
10-3-3. When a Command card is played or a triggered effect is triggered and its
effect instructs you to “choose 1 (card or player)” or “choose up to (some
number of cards),” those targets are chosen at the point in time when the
instructions appear in the effect.
10-3-3-1. If an effect’s target cannot be chosen, that effect does not activate.
10-3-4. If the text of an effect does not specifically indicate choosing a card or
player and the effect is meant to target a card, the card generating the effect
is indicated. If the effect is meant to target a player, the player who owns the
card generating the effect is indicated.
10-3-5. When choosing a card from the deck, confirm the top of the deck, then
choose the specified card from it.
11) Rules Management
11-1. Rules Management Fundamentals
11-1-1. Rules management is management stipulated within the rules that
automatically takes place when a specific event occurs or is occurring during
a game.
11-1-2. Immediately resolve rules management the moment an event occurs,
regardless of if other actions are being performed.
11-2. Determination of Defeat Management
11-2-1. At the start of rules management, if any player fulfills a condition for defeat,
all players fulfilling a condition for defeat are immediately defeated.
11-2-1-1. When any player receives battle damage from a Unit while they have
no cards in their shield area, that player fulfills a condition for defeat.
11-2-1-2. When any player has no cards in their deck, that player fulfills a
condition for defeat.
11-3. Destruction Management
11-3-1. When the HP of a Unit, Base, or Shield becomes zero less after receiving
damage, that Unit, Base, or Shield is destroyed. The destroyed card is placed
into the trash.
11-3-1-1. Shields are treated as having 1 HP each.
11-4. Battle Area Excess Management
11-4-1. Units in the battle area are limited to six at most.
24
11-4-2. If the battle area is at its upper limit when a Unit card is being played or a
Unit is being deployed by an effect, choose one Unit already in the battle
area and place it into the trash.
11-4-2-1. Units placed into the trash due to this management are not
considered to be destroyed.
11-4-2-2. When multiple Units are deployed simultaneously, place an equal
number of Units already in the battle area into the trash.
11-5. Managing Shield Area Base Section Excess
11-5-1. The base section is limited to one Base at most.
11-5-2. If the base section is full when a new Base card is played or a new Base is
deployed by some effect, choose one Base already in the base section and
place it into the trash.
11-5-2-1. Bases placed into the trash due to this management are not
considered to be destroyed.
12) Multiplayer Battle
12-1. These rules cover games played between three or more players. Battle royale can
be played with three or more players, and team battle can be played with four
players.
12-2. Battle royale rules are for multiplayer battles between three or more players in
which each player battles all of the other players as opponents. Rules for deck
construction (see 6. Preparing to Play) and game progression (see 7. Game
Progression) are generally the same as those for two player battles.
12-2-1. All players use a method such as rock paper scissors to decide which of
them will go first. Player One then chooses either clockwise or
counterclockwise play. After that, when the active player’s turn ends, the
turn moves to the next player either clockwise or counterclockwise from
them depending on the direction first chosen.
12-2-2. All players except Player One place EX Resources while preparing to play.
12-2-3. The redrawing of hands is performed in order starting with Player One.
12-2-4. If players are simultaneously required to perform some action, such as
resolving effects, the active player does so first, followed by the next player in
order, and this continues one player at a time until all of them have finished
completing the action.
12-2-5. Battle royale has two possible victory conditions: “winner takes all” and
“last player standing.”
25
12-2-5-1. In winner-takes-all rules, if any player takes battle damage from a
Unit when they have no cards in their shield area, only the player
dealing battle damage to them wins. A player whose deck has no cards
remaining during a game is removed from the game at that point,
together with all of their cards and effects.
12-2-5-2. In last-player-standing rules, the last player to remain undefeated
wins. The same as in two player games, when a player receives battle
damage or has no cards in their deck, all of their cards and effects are
removed from the game at that point.
12-2-6. If an effect or such indicates “enemy” or “opponent,” it refers to any and all
of the other players.
12-2-7. If you attack with a Unit, you can attack any other player’s rested Unit or
any other player.
12-2-8. Action steps are performed in order starting with the next player after the
active player. They end when all players have chosen to pass.
12-3. Team battle rules are for multiplayer battles between two teams consisting of two
players each. Rules for deck construction (see 6. Preparing to Play) and game
progression (see 7. Game Progression) are generally the same as those for two
player battles.
12-3-1. Each team proceeds through each turn phase as a team rather than
individually.
12-3-2. Team members sit beside one another at the table, and the player seated
on the right is that team’s leader. The team leaders use a method such as
rock paper scissors to decide which team goes first.
12-3-3. In team battle, a player’s hand, Resources, cards on the field, and other
locations are not shared within the team, with the exception of a shared
shield area. Cards cannot be lent or borrowed, and a player cannot pay a cost
for their teammate or use their Lv. when referencing it to play cards.
12-3-4. Team members are free to share information and strategies. If there is a
disagreement, the team leader has the final say.
12-3-5. Unlike preparing to play for a two-player battle (see 6. Preparing to Play),
each player takes the top four cards of their deck, one at a time while taking
turns, and places them face down into the team’s shared shield area without
looking at them. When doing so, place each card so it overlaps the previous
one, starting with the card nearest to you.
12-3-6. When placing EX Resources while preparing to play, each player on Team 
26
Two places one card.
12-3-7. A team can only deploy one Base into the base section of their shared
shield area, and only one EX Base is placed into the base section when
preparing to play.
12-3-8. If a Shield receives damage or is added to a player’s hand, the top Shield of
the shared shield area is chosen, and it is placed into the trash or hand of that
card’s owner.
12-3-9. Rules for winning and losing the game in team battle are the same as those
for two player battles.
12-3-9-1. If any player receives battle damage from a Unit when there are no
cards in their team’s shared shield area, that team fulfills the condition
for defeat.
12-3-9-2. When any player has no cards remaining in their deck, that player’s
team fulfills the conditions for defeat.
12-3-10. If an effect or such indicates “friendly,” it refers to both your and your
teammate’s cards.
12-3-11. If any effect or such indicates “you” or “your,” it refers only to the owner
of that card.
12-3-12. If you attack with a Unit, you may attack one of the opposing team’s
rested Units or the opposing team itself. If you attack the opposing team,
check their shared shield area.
12-3-13. You can activate your <Blocker> effects even when your teammate’s Unit
is attacked.

13) Keyword Effects and Keywords
13-1. Keyword Effects
13-1-1. <Repair>
13-1-1-1. <Repair> is a keyword effect that activates at the end of your turn.
<Repair (amount)> indicates the effect “At the end of your turn, this
Unit recovers (amount) HP.”
13-1-1-2. If a Unit with <Repair> gains a new copy of <Repair> from some
effect, rather than gaining multiple copies, the amount from the new
copy of <Repair> is added to the original.
Ex: If a Unit with <Repair 1> gains <Repair 2>, the <Repair> effect on
that Unit becomes <Repair 3>.
13-1-2. <Breach>
27
13-1-2-1. <Breach> is a keyword effect that activates when the Unit destroys
an enemy Unit with battle damage. <Breach (amount)> indicates the
effect “when this Unit destroys an enemy Unit with battle damage
during your turn, <Breach> deals (amount) damage to the first card in
the shield area of the opponent who owns the destroyed Unit.”
13-1-2-2. Dealing damage to the first card in the shield area deals that damage
to the enemy Base if there is one. Otherwise, it deals that damage to
the enemy’s topmost Shield.
13-1-2-3. It activates even when both Units are destroyed in battle.
13-1-2-4. If there is neither a Base nor Shields in the enemy’s shield area, the
<Breach> effect does not activate.
13-1-2-5. If a Unit with <Breach> gains a new copy of <Breach> from some
effect, rather than gaining multiple copies, the amount from the new
copy of <Breach> is added to the original.
Ex: If a Unit with <Breach 1> gains <Breach 2>, the <Breach> effect on
that Unit becomes <Breach 3>.
13-1-3. <Support>
13-1-3-1. <Support> is a keyword effect that activates when you rest the Unit.
<Support (amount)> indicates the effect “【Activate･Main】Rest this
Unit：Choose one other friendly unit. It gets AP+(amount) during
this turn.”
13-1-3-2. If a Unit with <Support> gains a new copy of <Support> from
some effect, rather than gaining multiple copies, the amount from the
new copy of <Support> is added to the original.
Ex: If a Unit with <Support 1> gains <Support 2>, the <Support> effect
on that Unit becomes <Support 3>.
13-1-4. <Blocker>
13-1-4-1. <Blocker> is a keyword effect that can change the attack target to
the Unit with <Blocker> when you declare a block and rest that Unit.
13-1-4-2. Multiple copies of <Blocker> cannot be given to the same Unit.
13-1-5. <First Strike>
13-1-5-1. <First Strike> is a keyword effect that deals battle damage before
the enemy does when the attacking Unit battles.
13-1-5-2. Dealing battle damage before the enemy means it deals battle
damage first during the damage step (7-6). During normal
management, both Units deal battle damage simultaneously, but a 
28
Unit with <First Strike> deals damage first, after which the Unit
targeted for attack deals damage. If the enemy Unit or Base is
destroyed by this battle damage, battle damage from the Unit or Base
targeted for attack is not received.
13-1-5-3. Multiple copies of <First Strike> cannot be given to the same Unit.
13-1-6. <High-Maneuver>
13-1-6-1. <High-Maneuver> is a keyword effect that is continuously active
while the Unit is attacking. <High-Maneuver> indicates the effect
“While this Unit is attacking, enemy Units cannot activate <Blocker>.”
13-1-6-2. Multiple copies of <High-Maneuver> cannot be given to the same
